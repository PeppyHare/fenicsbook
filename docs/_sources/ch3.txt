Chapter 3: A Gallery of finite element solvers
------------------------------------------------

The goal of this chapter is to demonstrate how a range of important PDEs from science and engineering can be quickly solved with a few lines of FEniCS code. We start with the heat equation and continue with a nonlinear Poisson equation, the equations for linear elasticity, the Navier–Stokes equations, and finally look at how to solve systems of nonlinear advection–diffusion–reaction equations. These problems illustrate how to solve time-dependent problems, nonlinear problems, vector-valued problems, and systems of PDEs. For each problem, we derive the variational formulation and express the problem in Python in a way that closely resembles the mathematics.
